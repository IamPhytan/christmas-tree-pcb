For Christmas 2023, I designed and built these Christmas tree PCBs as gifts for my relatives.
I also used this project as an opportunity to learn PCB Art, ATtiny microcontroller programming, and SMD component soldering.
This project demonstrates how free and open-source software can be leveraged to realize hardware and software projects.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to @nadarbreicq for helping me choose the right family of ATtiny for my project needs.
Both Barbatronic and Heliox made good videos for anyone starting projects with ATtiny microcontrollers:

* @HelioxLab - _Program microcontrollers for your circuit boards! (ATtiny)_: https://youtu.be/KPtmi16cyaA

This project has been realized with the following stack of Free Open-Source Software. Thanks to the maintainers and contributors of these software tools:

* [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org) for the outline
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) for the decoration and the art on the PCB
* [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org) for the PCB design
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) for programming
