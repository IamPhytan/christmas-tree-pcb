# Christmas Tree Shaped PCB

## PCB Edge Cut

The edge cut of the PCB was originally designed in 2023 with RealThunder's [FreeCAD Link Branch](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD), using the [KicadStepUp Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/KicadStepUp_Workbench).
The file [`christmas-tree-pcb.FCStd`](mcad/christmas-tree-pcb.FCStd) of this repo, contains a copy of the PCB sketch, made with [FreeCAD 1.0](https://wiki.freecad.org/Release_notes_1.0).

## Solder Mask

The golden star and garlands are drawn using the front copper layer and a solder mask. While the outline of the garlands was [drawn on the front solder mask](../mcad/front-mask.svg) with KiCad, they were [filled](../mcad/garlands.svg) using Inkscape.

| Front Mask                      | Garlands                         |
